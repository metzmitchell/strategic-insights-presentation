### **Marketing Strategy**

#### **Current Situation**

Rowan Construction is a high-end, design-build firm in Phoenix, AZ, specializing in luxury custom homes and mid-scale renovations.

**Assets:**
* **Strong Referral Engine:** Over 60% of our qualified leads currently come from referrals (past clients, architects, and realtors), indicating high client satisfaction and a strong local reputation.
* **Premium Brand Positioning:** With an average custom home price of $1.5M, we are positioned in the upper echelon of the market, attracting affluent clients who value quality craftsmanship.
* **Targeted Digital Advertising:** We have a consistent lead flow from Google Ads, capturing high-intent searchers for our core services.
* **Proven Event Marketing Success:** Our participation in events like the Parade of Homes has historically generated significant lead spikes and brand visibility.
* **Upcoming Community Launch:** We have a strategic opportunity with the upcoming **Oak Leaf Community** launch, providing a focal point for marketing efforts in Q2/Q3.

**Challenges:**
* **Low Marketing Investment:** Our current marketing spend is less than 1% of revenue. While efficient, this may be insufficient to drive aggressive growth and could leave us vulnerable to shifts in the referral market.
* **Lead Source Diversification:** An over-reliance on referrals is a risk. We need to build more robust, independent channels for lead generation to ensure a predictable pipeline.
* **Broad Market Awareness:** While known within niche professional circles, our brand awareness among the wider affluent population of Phoenix and relocation buyers could be significantly improved.

### **Business Goals**

We want to establish Rowan Construction as the premier design-build firm in the Phoenix area for luxury, energy-efficient homes by systematically increasing our lead flow, revenue, and brand authority.

### **Positioning**

**Customer Promise (universal value)**
Every Rowan Construction home is a fixed-price, design-led masterpiece, delivered on the date we promise—so you can enjoy your new life in Phoenix, not manage a construction project.

| Feature | Builder-speak | Homeowner-speak |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fixed pricing | Cost-plus alternative | “Know exactly what you’ll pay—no surprises.” |
| Design-build | Integrated team | “One team handles everything from sketches to handing you the keys.” |

**Key Differentiators (why us, not them)**
* **Guaranteed move-in date** → “Plan your life and your move with certainty, not delays.”
* **High-performance, energy-efficient builds** → “Your home stays comfortable year-round, and your utility bills stay low.”
* **A personal project concierge** → “You’ll have one point of contact for white-glove service and proactive updates from start to finish.”

#### **Market Position**

**Step A — Map it**

* **Y-Axis:** Process (Fragmented [Architect + GC] → Integrated [Full Design-Build])
* **Our Position:** Rowan Construction sits in the upper-right quadrant: **Ultra-Luxury Price** and **Fully Integrated Process**. This is our defensible white space against volume builders (lower-left) and traditional architect-led projects that can lack cost and timeline control.
